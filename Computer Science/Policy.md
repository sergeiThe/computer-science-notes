What is a policy?::Algorithm for making some kind of decisions within the OS. 
<!--SR:!2022-09-07,1,230-->

For example, given a number of possible programs to run on a CPU, which program should the OS run? A scheduling policy in the OS will make this decision, likely using historical information (e.g., which program has run more over the last minute?), workload knowledge (e.g., what types of programs are run), and performance metrics (e.g., is the system optimizing for interactive performance, or throughput?) to make its decision.
