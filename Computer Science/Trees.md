**Description**: Only one path between nodes, otherwise it is a graph



## Terminology

- Node
- Edge
- Path
- Root
- Over-under
- Parent/child
- Internal node
- Terminalnode (leaf)
- Grad
- Level
- Depth
- Height
- Path length
- Sorted/unsorted
- Sub-tree
- Forest
- Multipath tree
- Binary tree
- Full tree
- Complete tree


## Rules/properties

1. Exactly one path between two nodes
2. N nodes have N-1 edges
3. Binary trees: N nodes have N+1 empty children/nullptr
4. Full balanced tree: height is ca. log<sub>2</sub>


## Traversing trees - 4 ways

1. [[Pre-order]]: 
	- Visit oneself
	- Traverse left
	- Traverse right
2. [[In-order]]:
	- Traverse left
	- Visit oneself
	- Traverse right
3. [[Post-order]]:
	- Traverse left
	- Traverse right
	- Visit oneself
4. [[Level-order]]:
	- Visit all one line at a time from left to right, from top to bottom
