## Early Operating Systems: Just Libraries

Set of libraries of commoly-used functions. API for making developers' lifes easier.

One program ran at a time. [[Batch]] processing. Too expensive to use for a regular user.

## Beyond Libraries: Protection

Any file could read any other file. Thus, the idea of a [[System call|system call]] was invented. Instead of providing OS routines as a library (where you just make a [[Procedure call|procedure call]] to access them), it was added special hardware instructions and hardware state to make the transition into the OS a more formal, controlled process.


## Era of Multiprogramming

Improvement of [[CPU]] utilization. Multiple jobs could be loaded into memory and OS could switch rapidly between them.


## Modern Era

Personal computer. Poorly programmed OS that lacked memory protection made a leap backwards.
