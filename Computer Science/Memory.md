# Memory

Memory is just an array of bytes. A [[program]] keeps all of its data structures in memory, and accesses them through various [[Instruction|instructions]] like loads and stores or other explicit instructions that access memory in doing their work. 

Each instruction is in memory too, thus memory is accessed on each instruction fetch.
