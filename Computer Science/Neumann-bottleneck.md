In the von Neumann architecture, programs and data are held in memory. The processor and memory are separate and data moves between the two. 

This configuration causes unavoidable latency.

Furthermore, in recent years, processor speeds have increased significantly. Memory improvements, on the other hand, have mostly been in density – the ability to store more data in less space – rather than [transfer rates](https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/data-transfer-rate). 

As speeds have increased, the processor has spent an increasing amount of time idle, waiting for data to be [fetched](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/fetch) from memory. No matter how fast a given processor can work, in effect it is limited to the rate of transfer allowed by the [bottleneck](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/bottleneck). Often, a faster processor just means that it will spend more time idle.

## Approaches for overcoming the bottleneck

1. [[Cache|Caching]]
2. Prefetching
3. [[Multithreading]]
4. New types of RAM
5. RAMBUS
6. Processing in memory (PIM)
